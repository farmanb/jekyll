I am currently an Assistant Professor and the Capital One Endowed Professor of Mathematics in the [Mathematics Program](https://ulm.edu/math) within the [School of Sciences](https://www.ulm.edu/sciences/) at the [University of Louisiana at Monroe](https://ulm.edu)
I am also a [Project NExT (New Experiences in Teaching)](https://www.maa.org/programs-and-communities/professional-development/project-next) fellow in the Red '22 cohort.
I was previously a Visiting Assistant Professor in the [Department of Mathematics](http://math.lafayette.edu) at [Lafayette College](http://lafayette.edu).

I am a Vermonter, born and raised. When I'm not doing mathematics, I tend to spend my time outdoors. I enjoy hiking, backpacking, cycling, gardening during the summers and snowboarding in the winter.
